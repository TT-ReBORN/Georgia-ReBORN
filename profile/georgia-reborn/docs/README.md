<h2 align="center">A Clean · Full Dynamic Color Reborn · Foobar2000 player</h2>

Georgia-ReBORN is a feature-rich foobar2000 theme developed and based on Mordred's **[original Georgia](https://github.com/kbuffington/Georgia)**.<br />
Its purpose is to be used mainly as a desktop version; the layout has been modified to look clean and simple<br />
without any distractions. The cover artwork and playlist are the main focus. Besides the 11 existing themes<br />
Georgia-ReBORN has to offer ( Options > Theme ), there is one special theme, "Reborn". Based on Mordred's<br />
awesome dynamic color change feature, this theme will completely change its appearance based on album art,<br />
meaning there are unlimited possibilities for how the player will look. Every new album you play will be<br />
a new experience! You can also create custom themes and share them with the community. For more information,<br />
go to Options > Theme > Custom > Edit custom theme and click on Options > Info.

If you want to change the active theme's default look, you can activate different styles ( Options > Style ).<br />
Each column in the context menu can have one activated style, meaning you can combine styles altogether.<br />
It should be noted that some active themes have more or fewer different styles available;<br />
you can spend hours experimenting and achieving some pretty cool results. There are also predefined<br />
theme presets ( Options > Preset ) for each theme, with a total of 88 different ones. For quick access,<br />
try clicking on the lower bar to pick a random theme preset. A pretty cool feature is the preset harmonic<br />
select mode ( Options > Preset > Select mode ), which will automatically adjust and pick a harmonic preset<br />
based on the current playing album art.

![Styles](https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN-resources/blob/master/02_Georgia_Reborn_Theme_Styles_Animation.webp)

WilB's awesome library and biography script has been integrated and modified to fit the overall design.<br />
You can choose top Menu > Options > Library to change various library options. Besides the 8 existing<br />
built-in designs, the library has its own default Georgia-ReBORN design. The classical tree view can be changed<br />
swiftly by right-clicking for the context menu and choosing "Show album art". You can switch back to the default<br />
tree view by right-clicking and choosing "Tree view".

When album art is active, new options are available in Options > Library > Album art.<br />
The layout feature is not available for "List view + album covers/artist photos" and "Flow mode".<br />
For convenience, when album art is active, you can easily change the layout by right-clicking and choosing:<br />
Change layout to full width or Change layout to normal width, depending on the current state.<br />
Another cool feature is dynamic thumbnail resizing; thumbnail size will change dynamically according<br />
to the foobar player size.

If you want to display artist photos in the library, you need to link your path to your biography directory.<br />
Go to File > Preferences > Display and under Album art, click on the Artist tab. Here, you need to set<br />
your full path, e.g: E:\foobar2000\profile\cache\biography\biography-cache\art_img\\$cut(%artist%,1)\\%artist%\\*<br />
If you now fetch the images from the biography, it will automatically update your library with the photos.<br />
You can easily switch the view from albums to artists. If album art or flow mode is active, right-click<br />
in the library > Show artists; to go back to the default view, open the context menu again and choose Show albums.

![Library](https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN-resources/blob/master/03_Georgia_Reborn_Library_Animation.webp)

In the biography, you can change options via top menu Options > Biography or use the context menu.<br />
There are 4 different biography layouts to choose from; top is the default. There is also an automatic lyric fetcher.<br />
Synced lyrics will be highlighted with a theme color; unsynced lyrics have the default white text color.<br />

![BiographyLyrics](https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN-resources/blob/master/04_Georgia_Reborn_Biography_And_Lyrics_Animation.webp)

Georgia-ReBORN supports 4K resolutions and will adjust theme elements based on DPI and screen size.<br />
Fullscreen mode is also supported! There are predefined sizes ( Options > Player size ) and each layout<br />
has 3 different sizes. You can, of course, resize foobar to your liking, but it has minimum size restrictions<br />
to prevent button and text overlapping. There are 3 different layouts to choose from ( Options > Layout ).<br />

![Sizes](https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN-resources/blob/master/05_Georgia_Reborn_Sizes_And_Layouts_Animation.webp)

**NOTE:** Georgia-ReBORN starts in player size 'Small' as a failsafe player size for small res. monitor/laptop screens<br />
and looks best if you switch to 'Normal' or a larger player size!
